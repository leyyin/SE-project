Notice, you need Python 3.4+ for this steps to work.

1. Create and activate [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/venv.html)

2. If you get a weird error on some systems regarding pip, [follow this setup](https://gist.github.com/denilsonsa/21e50a357f2d4920091e#pyvenv-34-ubuntu-1404-also-debian).

3. Install required dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running
If you are not not in the virtual environment you must change to it.
 
`python manage.py run`
